# NFT-Coating Package Native Applications

NFT's Manifesto is based on the idea that a truly sustainable system can only be built with fewer synthetic products. The human-natural balance has been lost. Industrial production methods are in direct opposition to the environment and our quality of life, as well as generating an enormous waste stream.

For this reason, we have created Package Native Applications (PNAs) for iOS devices that are able to communicate with one another and share device resources - especially energy and data - in order to optimize each PNA's performance. Our PNA is designed to be adapted towards the user and their lifestyle, greatly benefiting from having a continuous connection with all of the other nearby PNA's. NFT's Package Native Application (PNAs) are truly native applications that rely on "native" protocols to communicate with each other and other devices.

Through our revolutionary PNAs we aim to improve how people live and how they interact with the world around them. We want to create a system based on sharing, in which we learn how to coexist more efficiently. We want everyone to become more aware and responsible for their actions.

We have built a team of developers with many different skills who are working tirelessly to make this system a reality. We are also using crowdfunding to raise funds for the project. So far, our team has been able to create an iOS application that can connect with other devices via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. The current version of this app is only a prototype which allows us to test the concept and prove that it is viable. We are raising money in order to continue development of the app and create versions for Android, Windows Phone, Ubuntu touch and desktop browsers.

We have set up our own Software Development Kit (SDK) in order to allow third party applications to integrate with Package Native Applications by using open communication protocols.
